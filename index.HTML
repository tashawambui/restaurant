    <h2>Cake</h2>
    Cakes are sweet baked goods typically made from flour, sugar, eggs, and a leavening agent like baking powder or baking
    soda. They come in various types, such as sponge cakes, butter cakes, and flourless cakes, and can be simple or
    elaborate. Cakes are often decorated with icing, fruits, or nuts and are commonly served during celebrations like
    birthdays and weddings. The word "cake" originates from the Old Norse word "kaka," and its history dates back to ancient
    times.

    <h2>Steak</h2>
    Steak is a slice of meat, typically cut across the muscle fibers, often including a bone. It is most commonly made from
